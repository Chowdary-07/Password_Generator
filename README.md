# Password_Generator
The 100 Lines of code from scratch written in python to check password strength and to generate random passwords
The libaries I used:
                    #string
                    #random
                    #regex
'string.ascii_letters' used to generate of both cap's and small chacracters
'string.ascii_digits' for random digits
'string.ascii_punctuation' for random special symbols
random.choices(....... ,k=n(weights)) for random selction with in range.

Oops concept to reuse the code with classes and object's.
